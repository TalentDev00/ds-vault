ds-vault
========

This repository contains a very simple utility called a "vault".
The purpose of a vault is also very simple: to hold ERC20 tokens.

A vault is useful any time you need to segregate token holdings into
several distinct buckets, or when you want to set up a shared account,
perhaps owned by a multisig <https://github.com/nexusdev/ds-multisig>.

A single vault is able to hold any number of different ERC20 tokens.

Vaults are protected by `DSAuth` <https://github.com/nexusdev/ds-auth>,
which means they support sophisticated access control out of the box.

Whoever owns or controls a `DSVault` can tell it to perform token
operations, such as transferring X amount of token Y to account Z,
or even (as long as the vault has the necessary ERC20 approval)
transferring X amont of token Y from account W to account Z.

Anyone is free to make deposits to a vault by simply transferring
tokens directly into it using the regular ERC20 `transfer` function.
The owner of a vault can also ask the vault to perform the transfer.

Vaults are very staightforward to understand and think about, and can
be a useful building block in many different kinds of applications.
